\chapter{Background}\label{sec:chapter2}

In this chapter the mathematical background that later chapters rely on is introduced.
\cref{sec:chapter2_signals_sphere} begins with a review of signals on the sphere on which much of this work is built.
Localised spatial-scale analysis is considered through wavelets in \cref{sec:chapter2_wavelets}, followed by localised spatial-spectral analysis via the Slepian concentration problem in \cref{sec:chapter2_slepian_concentration_problem}.
The primary motivation behind this work, namely: observations over the partial sphere in cosmology is discussed in \cref{sec:chapter2_motivation}.
Lastly, limitations of existing approaches and the aim of this thesis is covered in \cref{sec:chapter2_outlook}.

\section{Signals on the Sphere}\label{sec:chapter2_signals_sphere}

Much of this thesis is based on signals on the sphere, and as such some appropriate mathematical background is introduced here.
Signals on the sphere arise in many areas of science and engineering, including: cosmology~\cite{Bennett1996}, geophysics~\cite{Simons2006}, planetary science~\cite{Turcotte1981}, quantum chemistry~\cite{Choi1999}, computer vision~\cite{Cohen2018,Esteves2020,Cobb2021}, and computer graphics~\cite{Ramamoorthi2004}.

\subsection{Notation}

The 2-sphere \(\twoSphere{}\) is defined as
%
\begin{equation}
	\twoSphere{}
	%
	= \set{\omega \in \mathbb{R}^{3} : \norm{\omega} = 1},
\end{equation}
%
where \(\omega=(\theta,\phi)\) parameterise a point on the unit sphere, \(\theta \in \interval{0}{\pi}\) is the colatitude and \(\phi \in \interval[open right]{0}{2\pi}\) is the longitude.
The Hilbert space \(\hilbert{\twoSphere}\) is formed by the complex valued square-integrable functions \(\pixel{f}\), \(\pixel{g}\), with inner product
%
\begin{equation}
	\braket*{f}{g}
	%
	= \integrateSphere{\omega} \pixel{f} \pixel{\conj{g}},
\end{equation}
%
where \(\sphereVolume{} = \sin{\theta} \dd{\theta} \dd{\phi}\) is the usual rotation invariant measure on the sphere.
The complex inner product induces a norm
%
\begin{equation}
	\norm{f}
	%
	= \sqrt{\braket*{f}}.
\end{equation}
%
Signals on the sphere are functions with a finite induced norm.

\subsection{Spherical Harmonics}

The spherical harmonics \(\pixel{\harmonic{Y}}\), with integer degree \(\ell \geq 0\) and integer order \(m \leq \abs{\ell}\), form an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space \(\hilbert{\twoSphere}\).
Consider the Laplacian in spherical coordinates
%
\begin{equation}
	\laplacian
	%
	= \frac{1}{r^{2}} \pdv{r} \bigg(r^{2} \pdv{r}\bigg)
	%
	+ \frac{1}{r^{2}\sin{\theta}} \pdv{\theta} \bigg(\sin{\theta} \pdv{\theta}\bigg)
	%
	+ \frac{1}{r^{2}\sin^{2}{\theta}} \pdv[2]{\phi}.
\end{equation}
%
The spherical harmonics are found by solving the Laplace equation
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chapter2_laplace}
	\laplacian{f(r,\theta,\phi)}
	%
	= 0,
\end{equation}
%
and substituting in a separation of variables
%
\begin{equation}
	f(r,\theta,\phi)
	%
	= R(r)\Theta(\theta)\Phi(\phi).
\end{equation}
%
Inserting this decomposition into the Laplace equation \cref{eq:chapter2_laplace}, and multiplying by \(r^{2}\sin^{2}{\theta}/R\Theta\Phi{}\) yields
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chapter2_laplace_m2}
	\frac{1}{\Phi} \pdv[2]{\Phi}{\phi}
	%
	= -\frac{\sin^{2}{\theta}}{R} \dv{r} \bigg(r^{2} \dv{R}{r}\bigg)
	%
	- \frac{\sin{\theta}}{\Theta} \dv{\theta} \bigg(\sin{\theta} \dv{\Theta}{\theta}\bigg)
	%
	= -m^{2},
\end{equation}
%
where \(-m^{2}\) is a constant chosen such that the solutions for \(\Phi(\phi)\) are periodic in \(\phi{}\), \ie{}
%
\begin{equation}
	\Phi(\phi)
	%
	= \exp(\pm i m\phi).
\end{equation}
%
Now, after dividing through by \(\sin^{2}{\theta}\), \cref{eq:chapter2_laplace_m2} may be recast as
%
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{R} \dv{r} \bigg(r^{2} \dv{R}{r}\bigg)
	%
	= -\frac{1}{\Theta\sin{\theta}} \dv{\theta} \bigg(\sin{\theta} \dv{\Theta}{\theta}\bigg)
	%
	+ \frac{m^{2}}{\sin^{2}{\theta}}
	%
	= \ell(\ell+1),
\end{equation}
%
where \(\ell(\ell+1)\) is a constant, the choice of which will become clear.
Through a change of variables \(x=\cos{\theta}\) and \(y=\Theta(\theta)\), the polar angle part reduces to
%
\begin{equation}
	(1-x^{2}) \dv[2]{y}{x} - 2x\dv{y}{x} + \bigg[\ell(\ell+1) - \frac{m^{2}}{(1 - x^{2})}\bigg] y
	%
	= 0,
\end{equation}
%
which is the differential equation for the associated Legendre polynomials \(y(x) = P^{m}_{\ell}(x)\).
The spherical harmonics are then formed by combining the solutions in the polar angle \(\theta{}\) and azimuthal angle \(\phi{}\) with a suitable normalisation factor by
%
\begin{equation}
	\pixel{\harmonic{Y}}
	%
	= {(-1)}^{m} \sqrt{\factor \frac{(\ell-m)!}{(\ell+m)!}} P^{m}_{\ell}(\cos{\theta}) \exp(i m\phi).
\end{equation}
%
Included here is the Condon-Shortley \({(-1)}^{m}\) phase factor, to ensure the following conjugate symmetry relation holds
%
\begin{equation}
	\pixel{\conj{\harmonic{Y}}}
	%
	= {(-1)}^{m} \pixel{Y_{\ell(-m)}}.
\end{equation}
%
The spherical harmonics satisfy the below orthonormality and completeness relations by
%
\begin{equation}
	\integrateSphere{\omega} \pixel{\harmonic{Y}} \pixel{\conj{\harmonic[']{Y}}}
	%
	= \delta_{\ell\ell'} \delta_{mm'},
\end{equation}
%
and
%
\begin{equation}
	\sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} \pixel{\harmonic{Y}} \pixel[']{\conj{\harmonic{Y}}}
	%
	= \delta(\omega-\omega')
\end{equation}
%
respectively, where
%
\begin{equation}
	\delta(\omega-\omega')
	%
	= \delta(\phi-\phi') \delta(\cos{\theta} - \cos{\theta'})
\end{equation}
%
and \(\delta(x),\ x \in \mathbb{R}\) is the Dirac delta function.
A function on the sphere \(f \in \hilbert{\twoSphere}\) may be decomposed into this basis by
%
\begin{equation}
	\pixel{f}
	%
	= \sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} \harmonic{f} \pixel{\harmonic{Y}},
\end{equation}
%
where \(\harmonic{f}\) are the spherical harmonic coefficients given by
%
\begin{equation}
	\harmonic{f}
	%
	= \integrateSphere{\omega} \pixel{f} \pixel{\conj{\harmonic{Y}}}.
\end{equation}
%
The conjugate symmetry relation of the spherical harmonic coefficients of a real function is
%
\begin{equation}
	\conj{\harmonic{f}}
	%
	= {(-1)}^{m} f_{\ell(-m)}.
\end{equation}
%
A useful relation for the spherical harmonics is the addition theorem which states
%
\begin{equation}
	\sum\limits_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} \pixel{\harmonic{Y}} \pixel[']{\conj{\harmonic{Y}}}
	%
	= \factor P_{\ell}(\omega \cdot \omega'),
\end{equation}
%
where \(P_{\ell}(x)\) are the Legendre polynomials.
A pictorial representation of the spherical harmonics is given in \cref{fig:chapter2_spherical_harmonics}.

\subsection{Rotations on the Sphere}

Rotations of functions defined on the sphere form an integral part of analysis on the sphere.
The Euler angles \(\rho=(\alpha,\beta,\gamma) \in \rotationGroup{}\) may parametrise three-dimensional rotations, where \(\alpha \in \interval[open right]{0}{2\pi}\), \(\beta \in \interval{0}{\pi}\), and \(\gamma \in \interval[open right]{0}{2\pi}\).
The sequence of rotations:
%
\begin{enumerate}[(i),nosep,left=\parindent]
	\item \({\gamma}\) rotation about the \(z\)-axis;
	\item \({\beta}\) rotation about the \(y\)-axis; and
	\item \({\alpha}\) rotation about the \(z\)-axis;
\end{enumerate}
%
define the rotation operator \(\rotation{\rho}\).
A function \(\pixel{f} \in \hilbert{\twoSphere}\) rotated on the sphere is defined by
%
\begin{equation}
	\pixel{(\rotation{\rho}f)}
	%
	= f(\rotationMatrix^{-1} \omega),
\end{equation}
%
where \(\rotationMatrix{}\) is the three-dimensional rotation matrix corresponding to \(\rotation{\rho}\).
A rotation of a spherical harmonic function may be represented by
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chapter2_wigner_ylm}
	\rotation{\rho} \pixel{\harmonic{Y}}
	%
	= \wignerSum \wigner{\ell}{n}{m}(\rho) \pixel{Y_{\ell n}},
\end{equation}
%
where \(\wigner{\ell}{n}{m}(\rho)\) are the Wigner D matrices~\cite{Brink1993,Ritchie1999}.
The Wigner D matrices form the \(2\ell+1\)-dimensional representation of the rotation group \(\rotationGroup{}\) for a given \(\ell{}\) and are given by
%
\begin{equation}
	\wigner{\ell}{n}{m}(\rho)
	%
	= \exp(-i n\alpha) \reducedWigner{\ell}{n}{m}(\beta) \exp(-i m\gamma),
\end{equation}
%
where \(\reducedWigner{\ell}{n}{m}(\beta)\) are the reduced d matrices which are real in this phase convention and satisfy many symmetry relations.
By the Peter-Weyl theorem, the matrix elements \(\wigner{\ell}{n}{m}(\rho)\) form an orthonormal basis on \(\hilbert{\rotationGroup}\), \ie{}
%
\begin{equation}
	\integrateRotation{\rho} \wigner{\ell}{n}{m}(\rho) \wigner[\ast]{\ell'}{n'}{m'}(\rho)
	%
	= \frac{8\pi^{2}}{2\ell+1} \delta_{\ell\ell'} \delta_{n n'} \delta_{mm'},
\end{equation}
%
where \(\rotationVolume = \sin{\beta}\dd{\alpha}\dd{\beta}\dd{\gamma}\) is the usual invariant measure on \(\rotationGroup{}\).
Similarly, they satisfy the following completeness relation
%
\begin{equation}
	\sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{\infty} \frac{2\ell+1}{8\pi^{2}} \wignerSum \sum\limits_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} \wigner{\ell}{n}{m}(\rho) \wigner[\ast]{\ell}{n}{m}(\rho')
	%
	= \delta(\rho-\rho'),
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
	\delta(\rho-\rho')
	%
	= \delta(\alpha-\alpha') \delta(\cos{\beta} - \cos{\beta'}) \delta(\gamma-\gamma').
\end{equation}
%
From \cref{eq:chapter2_wigner_ylm}, it follows that the harmonic coefficients of a rotated function read
%
\begin{equation}
	\harmonic{(\rotation{\rho}f)}
	%
	= \wignerSum \wigner{\ell}{m}{n}(\rho) f_{\ell n}.
\end{equation}
%
Note the order of the indices on \(\wigner{\ell}{m}{n}(\rho)\) here compared to \cref{eq:chapter2_wigner_ylm}.
A function on the rotation group \(F \in \hilbert{\rotationGroup}\) may be represented by an expansion in the Wigner D matrices
%
\begin{equation}
	F(\rho)
	%
	= \sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{\infty} \frac{2\ell+1}{8\pi^{2}} \sum\limits_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} \wignerSum F^{\ell}_{m n} \wigner{\ell}{m}{n}(\rho),
\end{equation}
%
where the Wigner harmonic coefficients \(F^{\ell}_{m n}\) are given by
%
\begin{equation}
	F^{\ell}_{m n}
	%
	= \integrateRotation{\rho} F(\rho) \wigner[\ast]{\ell}{m}{n}(\rho).
\end{equation}
%
A useful relation to note is the connection between the spherical harmonics and the axisymmetric rotation matrices
%
\begin{equation}
	\wigner[\ast]{\ell}{m}{0}(\phi,\theta,0)
	%
	= \sqrt{\inverseFactor} \pixel{\harmonic{Y}}.
\end{equation}

\section{Wavelets}\label{sec:chapter2_wavelets}

In Fourier theory, a (Euclidean) signal may be expressed as an infinite sum of sines and cosines.
A significant problem with Fourier analyses, however, is that only the frequency resolutions are known, and not the time resolutions.
Thus, one must seek alternative methods to essentially represent a signal in time and frequency simultaneously.
In these time-frequency joint representations, the idea is to cut the signal into multiple parts and analyse them independently, which can give more detail about the individual frequency components~\cite{Mallat2008}.
Although, making a suitable cut --- which corresponds to a convolution between the signal and the cutting window --- is non-trivial.
Suppose one seeks to find all frequency components present at a given time; naively, this could be achieved by performing a cut with a Dirac delta function.
However, since the Fourier transform of a Dirac delta consists of all possible frequencies (see \cref{fig:chapter2_dirac_fourier}), and a convolution in the time domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain, the signal would be smeared out on the frequency axis.
This problem occurs due to the Heisenberg uncertainty problem; which, in signal processing terms, states that it is impossible to know both the exact frequency, and the exact time of occurrence of this frequency in the signal.

Wavelet analysis is an important signal processing technique which can tackle the shortcomings of the Fourier transform.
A fully scalable, modulated window solves the signal-cutting problem; whereby, the window moves along the signal and a spectrum is calculated at all positions.
After repeating this process multiple times with progressively shorter/longer windows, the end result is a collection of time-frequency representations of the signal, all at different resolutions --- which is often referred to a multiresolution analysis.
\cref{fig:chapter2_ricker_wavelets} presents some example wavelets, Ricker wavelets~\cite{Ricker1953}, where each wavelet is constructed to probe specific frequency ranges.
In wavelet analysis, one typically refers to time-scale (or space-scale) representations, as opposed to time-frequency (like in Fourier theory), where scale is the reciprocal frequency.
\cref{sec:chapter2_continuous_wavelet_transform} follows with the introduction of the continuous wavelet transform.

\input{figures/chapter2/dirac_fourier}

\subsection{Continuous Wavelet Transform}\label{sec:chapter2_continuous_wavelet_transform}

The wavelet analysis described above is more formerly known as the continuous wavelet transform (CWT), which sates
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chapter2_cwt}
	\cwt{f}
	%
	= \int \dd{t} f(t) \Psi^{s\ast}_{\tau}(t),
\end{equation}
%
where \(\Psi^{s}_{\tau}(t)\) are the wavelets, and \(s\) and \(\tau{}\) are dimensionless variables which refer to scale and translation respectively.
\cref{eq:chapter2_cwt} demonstrates how a function \(f(t)\) may be decomposed into a set of wavelets \(\Psi^{s}_{\tau}(t)\) as basis functions.
The inverse wavelet transform is thus
%
\begin{equation}
	f(t)
	%
	= \int \dd{s} \int \dd{\tau} \cwt{f} \Psi^{s}_{\tau}(t).
\end{equation}
%
The wavelets derive from a single wavelet \(\Psi(t)\), the so-called mother wavelet, by scaling and translating, \ie{}
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chapter2_mother_wavelet}
	\Psi^{s}_{\tau}(t)
	%
	= \frac{1}{\sqrt{s}} \Psi\bigg(\frac{t-\tau}{s}\bigg),
\end{equation}
%
where the factor \(s^{-1/2}\) is for energy normalisation across different scales.
Here, a general framework has been developed, where the mother wavelet \(\Psi(t)\) is chosen for specific requirements, \eg{} Ricker wavelets are used in seismic wave propagation analyses~\cite{Wang2014}.

\subsubsection{Wavelet Properties}

The term wavelets arose from the satisfaction of the admissibility and regularity conditions.
The admissibility condition states that the square-integrable functions \(\Psi(t)\) which satisfy
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chapter2_admissibility}
	\int \dd{\varpi} \frac{\abs{\fourier{\Psi}(\varpi)}^{2}}{\abs{\varpi}}
	%
	< \infty
\end{equation}
%
can be used to analyse and then reconstruct a signal without loss of information~\cite{Sheng2010}, where \(\fourier{\Psi}(\varpi)\) is the Fourier transform of the wavelet \(\Psi(t)\).
Therefore, \cref{eq:chapter2_admissibility} implies that the Fourier transform of the wavelet vanishes at zero frequency, \ie{}
%
\begin{equation}
	\abs{\fourier{\Psi}(\varpi)} \bigg\rvert_{\varpi=0}
	%
	= 0;
\end{equation}
%
which means the spectrum experiences bandpass behaviour.
It also follows that, the average value of the wavelet in the time-domain must be zero, \ie{}
%
\begin{equation}
	\int \dd{t} \Psi(t)
	%
	= 0,
\end{equation}
%
which indicates that it must be an oscillatory function (a wave).
Regularity conditions are imposed such that the wavelets are somewhat smooth and concentrated in both time and frequency.
In \cref{eq:chapter2_cwt}, the wavelet transform of a one-dimensional function \(f(t)\) is two-dimensional --- and a two-dimensional function would have a four-dimensional transform \etc{}
Moreover, the square of the input signal is the time-bandlimit product of the wavelet transform.
Thus, some extra constraints are imposed on the wavelets such that they decrease rapidly as the scale \(s\) decreases.
For more detail on regularity see~\cite{Burrus1997,Daubechies1992}.

\subsubsection{Discrete Wavelets}

In practice, the CWT described in \cref{sec:chapter2_continuous_wavelet_transform} is impractical to use: namely, the wavelet transform \cref{eq:chapter2_cwt} is redundant, \ie{} the scaled functions do not form an orthogonal basis; the CWT has an infinite number of wavelets in the wavelet transform; and, most wavelet transforms do not have analytical solutions and hence must be computed numerically.
Discrete wavelets overcome these problems by modifying the continuous wavelet \cref{eq:chapter2_mother_wavelet} by
%
\begin{equation}
	\Psi^{j}_{k}(t)
	%
	= \frac{1}{\sqrt{s^{j}_{0}}} \Psi\Bigg(\frac{t - k\tau_{0}s^{j}_{0}}{s^{j}_{0}}\Bigg),
\end{equation}
%
where \(j\) and \(k\) are integers, \(s_{0}>1\) is a fixed dilation step, and \(\tau_{0}\) is the translation factor.
Thus, discrete wavelets may only be scaled and translated in discrete steps.
Discrete wavelets are used to transform a continuous signal into a series of wavelet coefficients, known as a wavelet decomposition.
A necessary and sufficient condition for stable signal reconstruction is the so-called Parseval frame property
%
\begin{equation}
	A \norm{f}^{2}
	%
	\leq \sum\limits_{j} \sum\limits_{k} \abs{\braket*{f}{\Psi^{j}_{k}}}^{2}
	%
	\leq B \norm{f}^{2},
\end{equation}
%
with \(A,\ B \in \realPosParam{}\)~\cite{Daubechies1992}.
When \(A=B=1\) the energy of \(f\) is conserved in wavelet space, and as such the wavelets act like an orthonormal basis, \ie{}
%
\begin{equation}
	\int \dd{t} \Psi^{j}_{k}(t) \Psi^{j'\ast}_{k'}(t)
	%
	= \delta_{j j'} \delta_{k k'},
\end{equation}
%
which solves the redundancy problem.
Therefore, a signal may be constructed by~\cite{Sheng2010}
%
\begin{equation}
	f(t)
	%
	= \sum\limits_{j} \sum\limits_{k} W^{j}_{k} \Psi^{j}_{k}(t),
\end{equation}
%
where \(W^{j}_{k}\) are the wavelet coefficients given by
%
\begin{equation}
	W^{j}_{k}
	%
	= \int \dd{t} f(t) \Psi^{j\ast}_{k}(t).
\end{equation}
%
To get good coverage with a finite number of wavelets, a logarithmic tiling of Fourier space (\ie{} frequency) is used to construct the wavelets, such as in \cref{fig:chapter2_tiling}.
A scaling function \(\Phi_{k}(t)\), in blue, captures the lower scales of the underlying function~\cite{Mallat1989}.

\section{Slepian Concentration Problem}\label{sec:chapter2_slepian_concentration_problem}

In the 1960s, Slepian, Landau and Pollak solved the fundamental problem of optimally concentrating a signal simultaneously in time and frequency~\cite{Landau1961,Landau1962,Slepian1983,Slepian1961}.
The resulting orthogonal family of functions, and their discrete and multidimensional counterparts~\cite{Bronez1988,Hanssen1997,Liu1992,Slepian1964,Slepian1978}, form the basis of a range of spectral analyses (\eg{}~\cite{Thomson1982,Thomson1990}).
\cref{sec:chapter2_slepian_euclidean} follows with a brief review of the initial time-frequency concentration problem, this is then extended to the spherical domain in \cref{sec:chapter2_slepian_sphere}.

\subsection{Euclidean: Time-Frequency Domain}\label{sec:chapter2_slepian_euclidean}

Before considering the Slepian spatial-spectral concentration problem in the spherical domain, first consider the one-dimensional, continuous-continuous, time-frequency concentration problem.
Here, a normalisation convention is adopted such that a real-valued time-domain single \(f(t)\) and its Fourier transform \(\fourier{f}(\varpi)\) are related by
%
\begin{equation}
	f(t)
	%
	= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \dd{\varpi} \fourier{f}(\varpi) \exp(i\varpi t)
\end{equation}
%
and
%
\begin{equation}
	\fourier{f}(\varpi)
	%
	= \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \dd{\varpi} f(t) \exp(-i\varpi t),
\end{equation}
%
where \(t\) and \(\varpi{}\) denote the time and angular frequency respectively.
Slepian and Pollak~\cite{Slepian1961} considered the problem of optimally concentrating a strictly bandlimited signal \(f(t)\), with a spectrum \(\fourier{f}(\varpi)\) which vanishes into a time interval \(\abs{t} \leq T\) for frequencies \(\abs{\varpi} > W\).
Through the Paley-Wiener theorem, no bandlimited signal \(g(t)\) can be exactly concentrated within a finite interval~\cite{Daubechies1992,Mallat2008}.
To find the optimally concentrated signal, one must maximise the following ratio
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chapter2_frequency_ratio}
	\mu
	%
	= \frac{\displaystyle\int\limits_{-T}^{T} \dd{t} \abs{g(t)}^{2}}
	%
	{\displaystyle\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \dd{t} \abs{g(t)}^{2}},
\end{equation}
%
although other criteria have been considered~\cite{Freeden1997,Riedel1995}.
Bandlimited signals \(g(t)\) which satisfy \cref{eq:chapter2_frequency_ratio}, have spectra \(\fourier{g}(\varpi)\) which satisfy the convolutional integral eigenproblem in the frequency-domain
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chapter2_frequency_eigenproblem}
	\int\limits_{-W}^{W} \dd{\varpi'} \frac{\sin{T(\varpi-\varpi')}}{\pi(\varpi-\varpi')} \fourier{g}(\varpi')
	%
	= \mu \fourier{g}(\varpi),
\end{equation}
%
where \(\abs{\varpi} \leq W\).

Slepian \etal{} also considered the similar case of concentrating the spectrum \(\fourier{h}(\varpi)\) of a strictly timelimited function \(h(t)\), which vanishes into a spectral interval \(\abs{\varpi} \leq W\) for times \(\abs{t} > T\).
The ratio to maximise here is
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chapter2_time_ratio}
	\mu
	%
	= \frac{\displaystyle\int\limits_{-W}^{W} \dd{\varpi} \abs{\fourier{h}(\varpi)}^{2}}
	%
	{\displaystyle\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \dd{\varpi} \abs{\fourier{h}(\varpi)}^{2}},
\end{equation}
%
which results in the time-domain eigenproblem
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chapter2_time_eigenproblem}
	\int\limits_{-T}^{T} \dd{t'} \frac{\sin{W(t-t')}}{\pi(t-t')} h(t')
	%
	= \mu h(t),
\end{equation}
%
where \(\abs{t} < T\).
In either case, the eigenvalues (which represent effective concentration) satisfy
%
\begin{equation}
	1 > \mu_{1} \geq \mu_{2} \geq \ldots > 0, % chktex 11
\end{equation}
%
with associated eigenfunctions, \eg{}
%
\begin{equation}
	g_{1}(t),\ g_{2}(t),\ \ldots
\end{equation}
%
which exist in the interval \(\abs{t} \leq T\).
Through a change of variables, the ratios \cref{eq:chapter2_frequency_ratio,eq:chapter2_time_ratio} may be transformed into one dimensionless eigenproblem
%
\begin{equation}
	\int\limits_{-1}^{1} \dd{y} \frac{\sin{TW(x-y)}}{\pi(x-y)} \zeta(y)
	%
	= \mu \zeta(x),
\end{equation}
%
where \(\abs{x} \leq 1\).
Hence, the eigenvalues and scaled eigenfunctions only depend on the time-bandlimit product \(TW\).
Consider the sum of the eigenvalues
%
\begin{equation}
	N
	%
	= \sum\limits_{p=1}^{\infty} \mu_{p}
	%
	= \frac{2TW}{\pi}.
\end{equation}
%
The so-called Shannon number~\cite{Percival1993} \(N\) introduced here is a good estimate of the number of significant eigenvalues, which arises due to the characteristic shape of the eigenvalue spectrum~\cite{Landau1965,Slepian1965} (see \cref{fig:chapter2_polar_cap_eigenvalues}).
Equivalently, this can be viewed as the number of signals \(f(t)\) which can be well-concentrated both into a finite time interval \(\abs{t} \leq T\) and a finite frequency interval \(\abs{\varpi} \leq W\).
Many of the results discussed above have analogues in the spatial-spectral concentration problem on the sphere, which is elaborated in \cref{sec:chapter2_slepian_sphere}.

\subsection{Sphere: Spatial-Spectral Domain}\label{sec:chapter2_slepian_sphere}

The two sub-spaces of interest of all square-integrable functions on the sphere \(\twoSphere{}\) are: \(\spaceSpacelimit{}\) the space of all spacelimited functions strictly contained within a region \(R\), and \(\spaceBandlimit{}\) the space of all bandlimited functions with no power above the bandlimit \(L\).
Akin to the Euclidean setting, no function can be strictly spacelimited as well as strictly bandlimited, \ie{} no \(\pixel{f}\) can be in both sub-spaces \(\spaceSpacelimit{}\) and \(\spaceBandlimit{}\) at the same time.
Thus, one may find either: the spacelimited functions \(\pixel{h} \in \spaceSpacelimit{}\) whose spectrum is optimally concentrated within the interval \(0 \leq \ell < L\), or the bandlimited functions \(\pixel{g} \in \spaceBandlimit{}\) which are optimally concentrated within a region \(R\).

\subsubsection{Spectral Concentration of a Spacelimited Function}

To maximise the concentration of a spacelimited function \(\pixel{h} \in \spaceSpacelimit{}\) within an interval \(0 \leq \ell < L\) one must maximise the ratio
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chapter2_spacelimited_ratio}
	\mu
	%
	= \frac{\displaystyle\sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{L-1} \sum\limits_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} \abs{\harmonic{h}}^{2}}
	%
	{\displaystyle\sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} \abs{\harmonic{h}}^{2}},
\end{equation}
%
which is analogous to the one-dimensional problem \cref{eq:chapter2_time_ratio}.
By substituting the expansion of the spherical harmonic coefficients
%
\begin{equation}
	\harmonic{h}
	%
	= \integrateRegion{\sphereVolume} \pixel{h} \pixel{\conj{\harmonic{Y}}},
\end{equation}
%
and swapping the order of summation and integration, the variational problem \cref{eq:chapter2_spacelimited_ratio} becomes
%
\begin{equation}
	\mu
	%
	= \frac{\integrateRegion{\sphereVolume[']} \pixel[']{h} \integrateRegion{\sphereVolume} \pixel{\delta_{\omega'}} \pixel{\conj{h}}}
	%
	{\integrateRegion{\sphereVolume} \abs{\pixel{h}}^{2}},
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
	\pixel{\delta_{\omega'}}
	%
	= \sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{L-1} \sum\limits_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} \pixel[']{\conj{\harmonic{Y}}} \pixel{\harmonic{Y}}
\end{equation}
%
is the bandlimited Dirac delta function.
The maximally spacelimited functions \(\pixel{h} \in \spaceSpacelimit{}\) are therefore the solutions to the integral equation
%
\begin{equation}
	\integrateRegion{\sphereVolume} \pixel{\delta_{\omega'}} \pixel{\conj{h}}
	%
	= \mu \pixel[']{\conj{h}},
\end{equation}
%
which is the spherical analogue of the one-dimensional time-domain eigenproblem \cref{eq:chapter2_time_eigenproblem}.

\subsubsection{Spatial Concentration of a Bandlimited Function}

Conversely, to find the maximally concentrated bandlimited functions \(\pixel{g} \in \spaceBandlimit{}\) within a region \(R\) one must maximise the ratio
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chapter2_bandlimited_ratio}
	\mu
	%
	= \frac{\integrateRegion{\sphereVolume} \abs{\pixel{g}}^{2}}
	%
	{\integrateSphere{\omega} \abs{\pixel{g}}^{2}},
\end{equation}
%
which is, as before, analogous to the one-dimensional problem \cref{eq:chapter2_frequency_ratio}.
Expanding in harmonic space, and swapping the order of summation and integration, \cref{eq:chapter2_bandlimited_ratio} becomes
%
\begin{equation}
	\mu
	%
	= \frac{\displaystyle\sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{L-1} \sum\limits_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} \harmonic{g}
		%
		\sum\limits_{\ell'=0}^{L-1} \sum\limits_{m'=-\ell'}^{\ell'} \Dmatrix \conj{\harmonic[']{g}}}
	%
	{\displaystyle\sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{L-1} \sum\limits_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} \abs{\harmonic{g}}^{2}},
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
	\Dmatrix
	%
	= \integrateRegion{\sphereVolume} \pixel{\harmonic{Y}} \pixel{\conj{\harmonic[']{Y}}}
\end{equation}
%
is an \(L \times L\) matrix.
The eigenproblem, of which the maximally bandlimited functions derive from, is
%
\begin{equation}
	\sum\limits_{\ell'=0}^{L-1} \sum\limits_{m'=-\ell'}^{\ell'} \Dmatrix \conj{\harmonic[']{g}}
	%
	= \mu \conj{\harmonic{g}},
\end{equation}
%
which is analogous to the one-dimensional frequency-domain eigenproblem \cref{eq:chapter2_frequency_eigenproblem}.

To explore this further, consider the straightforward case of finding the maximally concentrated functions within an axisymmetric polar cap of colatitudinal radius \(\theta_{0}{}\), centred on the north pole, \ie{}
%
\begin{equation}
	R
	%
	= \set{\theta: 0 \leq \theta \leq \theta_{0}}.
\end{equation}
%
\cref{fig:chapter2_slepian_polar_cap} presents the first sixteen Slepian functions \(\pixel{\slepian{S}}\) for a colatitude \(\theta_{0}=\SI{40}{\degree}\) and bandlimit \(L=16\).
The Shannon number is \(N=30\) for this region and bandlimit, and therefore all Slepian functions shown are well-concentrated within the region --- as shown by the eigenvalues \(\mu_{p}\), which are all \(\almost{1}\).
Visually, these polar cap Slepian functions look like the spherical harmonics (\cf{} \cref{fig:chapter2_spherical_harmonics}); where the number of positive/negative regions relates to the order \(m\) in the submatrix \(D_{\ell m,\ell'm}\).
The colatitudinal dependence is examined (by keeping \(\phi{}\) constant) for this region in \cref{fig:chapter2_slepian_colatitude} for \(p \in \set{1,6,15,30,51,72}\) shown left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
For the early \(p\) values the majority of the power of the signal is in the blue curve; however, by the final plot, most of the content of the signal is in the orange curve.
The corresponding eigenvalues \(\mu_{p}\) for this region are given in \cref{fig:chapter2_polar_cap_eigenvalues}, whereby the characteristic step shape around the Shannon number is observed.

\section{Motivation}\label{sec:chapter2_motivation}

\subsection{Overview}

\subsection{Cosmology}

The so-called Slepian functions allow one to perform localised spatial-spectral analyses; however, other methods such as the Karhunen-Loève theorem has enjoyed success in cosmology~\cite{Tegmark1997,Bond1994,Bunn1995}.
