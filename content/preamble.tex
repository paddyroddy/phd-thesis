\begin{abstract} % 300 word limit
	Many fields in science and engineering measure data which inherently live on non-Euclidean geometries such as the sphere.
	It is increasingly important that techniques initially developed in the one-dimensional Euclidean setting are extended to other geometries.
	Moreover, due to recent interest in geometric deep learning, analogues of Euclidean techniques must be developed to handle general manifold or graph data.
	Often, data are only observed or measured over a particular region of manifold and thus standard whole manifold techniques may not be appropriate for accurate predictions.
	In this work a new wavelet basis is designed specifically for datasets such as these.

	One tool fundamental in signal processing is the convolution.
	Although many definitions of a spherical convolution exist, none fully emulate the Euclidean definition.
	A novel spherical convolution is developed here which is designed to tackle the shortcomings of existing methods.
	The so-called sifting convolution exploits the sifting property of the Dirac delta and follows by the inner product of a function with the translated version of another.
	This translation operator is analogous to the Euclidean translation in harmonic space and exhibits some useful properties.
	In particular, the sifting convolution supports directional kernels; has an output that remains on the sphere; and is efficient to compute.
	The convolution is also entirely generic and thus may be used with any set of basis functions.

\begin{impactstatement}

	UCL theses now have to include an impact statement. The following text is the description from the guide linked from the formatting and submission website of what that involves. (Link to the guide: {\scriptsize \url{http://www.grad.ucl.ac.uk/essinfo/docs/Impact-Statement-Guidance-Notes-for-Research-Students-and-Supervisors.pdf}})

	\begin{quote}
		The statement describes, in no more than 500 words, how the expertise, knowledge, analysis,
		discovery or insight presented in your thesis could be put to a beneficial use. Consider benefits both
		inside and outside academia and the ways in which these benefits could be brought about.

		The benefits inside academia could be to the discipline and future scholarship, research methods,
		the curriculum; they might be within your research area and within other
		research areas.

		The benefits outside academia could occur to commercial activity, social enterprise, professional
		practice, clinical use, public health, public policy design, public service delivery, laws, public
		discourse, culture, the quality of the environment or quality of life.

		The impact could occur locally, regionally, nationally or internationally, to individuals, communities or
		organisations and could be immediate or occur incrementally, in the context of a broader field of
		research, over many years, decades or longer.

		Impact could be brought about through disseminating outputs (either in scholarly journals or
		elsewhere such as specialist or mainstream media), education, public engagement, translational
		research, commercial and social enterprise activity, engaging with public policymakers and public
		service delivery practitioners, influencing ministers, collaborating with academics and non-academics.

		Further information including a searchable list of hundreds of examples of UCL impact outside of
		academia please see \url{https://www.ucl.ac.uk/impact/}. For thousands more examples, please see
		\url{http://results.ref.ac.uk/Results/SelectUoa}.
