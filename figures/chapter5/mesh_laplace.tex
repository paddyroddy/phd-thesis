		The triangular mesh discretisation of a two-dimensional manifold.
		A triangular face is highlighted in red which connects the \(i\), \(j\) and \(k\) vertices, with the corresponding area represented as \(a_{i j k}\).
		Similarly, the vertex weight \(a_{i}\) is the red hexagonal shape which is effectively one-third of the area of the surrounding faces, \ie{} \cref{eq:chapter5_vertex_weight}.
		The \(i\) and \(j\) vertices are connected by an edge of length \(\ell_{i j}\), and the corresponding interior angles at the vertices \(k\) and \(h\) are given by \(\alpha_{i j}\) and \(\beta_{i j}\) respectively.
		These interior angles (in grey) appear in the expression for the cotangent Laplacian, \cf{} \cref{eq:chapter5_cotangent_laplace}.
