		A denoising demonstration for a field on the Homer mesh
	]{
		Panel (a) shows the data in the region \(R\) constructed from the Slepian coefficients of the per-vertex normals (\cf{} \cref{fig:chapter5_homer_data}) --- where the field value outside the region is set to negative infinity for illustrative purposes.
		Gaussian white noise is added to the signal in the Homer head region with a signal-to-noise ratio of \(\SI{0.32}{\dB}\), shown in panel (b).
		The scaling and wavelet coefficients of the noisy signal are calculated and are then hard-thresholded with \(N_{\sigma}=2\).
		The corresponding denoised plot is shown in panel (c), where the signal-to-noise ratio is boosted by \(\SI{1.93}{\dB}\) to \(\SI{2.25}{\dB}\).
		Whilst the signal values are defined on the vertices, they have been averaged onto the faces for the plot.
