		The tiling of the Slepian line with parameters \(\lambda=3\) and \(J_{0}=2\) with \(\imax=\num{1275}\) basis functions.
		The black dashed line marks the Shannon number for the Homer head region \(N=329\).
		It is clear that the scaling function and the first five wavelets are non-zero as the coefficients are within the Shannon number.
