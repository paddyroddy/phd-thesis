		A Dirac delta function and the result of a Fourier transform
	]{
		A visual demonstration of the problem with the Fourier transform.
		Panel (a) presents a Dirac delta in the time-domain; which is exactly localised in time, as expected.
		The result of a Fourier transform is shown in panel (b), which now consists of all possible frequencies.
		This phenomenon occurs due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
