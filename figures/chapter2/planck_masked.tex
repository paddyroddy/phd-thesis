		The \emph{Planck }\texttt{Commander} CMB temperature map used in low-\(\ell{}\) temperature likelihood analysis, smoothed to \(\SI{60}{\arcminute}\) FWHM resolution (courtesy of \emph{The Planck Collaboration 2018}~\cite{Planck2020a}).
		The region in grey is the mask adopted for the likelihood analysis, which preserves \(\SI{86}{\percent}\) of the sky.
		Rather than developing methods to estimate a full-sky map, Slepian wavelets offer an alternative approach in which the wavelets are constructed in the region outside the mask.
