        Some Ricker wavelets~\cite{Ricker1953} (also known as Mexican hat wavelets) shown alongside each other on the time axis.
        These wavelets arise as the second derivative of the Gaussian function.
        In wavelet analyses, a (Euclidean) signal is probed with many differently sized wavelets, such as these.
