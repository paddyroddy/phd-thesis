% UCL Thesis LaTeX Template
%  (c) Ian Kirker, 2014
%
% A template/skeleton for PhD/MPhil/MRes theses.
%
% It uses a rather split-up file structure because this tends to
%  work well for large, complex documents.
% It is suggested to use one file per chapter, but you may wish to use more
%  or fewer separate files than that.
% Various bits of configuration have been separated into their
%  own files, to keep everything neat.
% Note that the \input command just streams in whatever file you give
%  it, while the \include command adds a page break, and does some
%  extra organisation to make compilation faster. Note that you cannot
%  use \include inside an \include-d file.
% It is suggested to use \input for settings and configuration files that
%  you always want to use, and \include for each section of content.
% If you do that, it also means you can use the \includeonly statement
%  to only compile up the section you are interested in.
% You might also want to put figures into their own files to be \input.


% Formatting and binding rules for theses are here:
%  https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/research-assessments/format-bind-and-submit-your-thesis-general-guidance

% This package goes first, because it checks all
%  your syntax for mistakes and some old-fashioned LaTeX commands.
% Note that you load your documentclass before
%  packages, because some packages change behaviour based on
%  your document settings.
% Also, for those confused by the RequirePackage here vs usepackage
%  elsewhere, usepackage cannot be used before the documentclass
%  command, while RequirePackage can. That is the only functional
%  difference.
\RequirePackage[l2tabu, orthodox]{nag}


% ------ Main document class specification ------
% The draft option here prevents the insertion of images,
%  and adds chunky black bars to boxes that are exceeding
%  the page width (to show that they are).
% The oneside option can optionally be replaced by twoside if
%  you intend to print double-sided. Note that this is
%  *specifically permitted* by the UCL thesis formatting
%  guidelines.
%
% Valid options are:
%  phd
%  mres
%  mphil

% Package configuration:
%  LaTeX uses "packages" to add extra commands and features.
%  Several useful ones exist, so they have been put in a
%   separate file.
\input{config/main_packages}

% Sets up links within your document, for contents page entries
%  and references, and also PDF metadata.
% Edit this!
\input{config/links_and_metadata}

% And then some settings in separate files.
\input{config/float_settings} % For things like figures and tables
\input{config/bib_settings}   % For bibliographies
\input{config/macros}         % For maths

% These control how many number sections your subsections will take
%    such as Section 2.3.1.5.6.3
%  and how many of those will get put into the contents pages.

% \nobibliography*
% ^-- A trick that works with the bibentry package to let
%  you put bibliography entries wherever you like.
% Use this to put references to papers a chapter's work was
%  published in at the end of that chapter.
% For more information, see: http://stefaanlippens.net/bibentry

% If you have not finished making your full BibTex file yet, you
%  might find this useful -- it will just replace all your
%  citations with little superscript notes.
% Uncomment to use.
%\renewcommand{\cite}[1]{\emph{\textsuperscript{[#1]}}}

% At last, content! Remember filenames are case-sensitive and
%  *must not* include spaces.
\include{content/preamble}
\include{content/introduction}
\include{content/chapter2}
\include{content/chapter3}
\include{content/chapter4}
\include{content/chapter5}
\include{content/conclusions}
\include{content/appendices}
% You could separate these out into different files if you have
%  large appendices.

% Actually generates your bibliography. The last thing before this is
% \include which ensures that it is on a clear page.
\printbibliography[heading=bibintoc]

% All done. \o/
